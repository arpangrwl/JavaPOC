 * Objec­tive: Given two string sequences, write an algo­rithm to find the length of

 What is Longest Com­mon Sub­se­quence: A longest sub­se­quence is a sequence that
 appears in the same rel­a­tive order, but not nec­es­sar­ily contiguous(not sub­string) in both the string.

 String A = "acbaed";
 String B = "abcadf";
